# An exploration of Rust driver development in Linux

Source code can be found in `samples/rust`.

Also, `rust/bindings` includes Rust bindings for the Linux kernel headers generated by bindgen. This file is gitignored and 2 lines in it have to be commented out for `rust_dummy.rs` to compile (see comment in `rust_dummy.rs`).
